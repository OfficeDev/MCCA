# Overview

Microsoft Compliance Configuration Analyzer (MCCA) is a tool which, on execution, generates a report highlighting known issues in your compliance configurations in achieving data protection guidelines and recommends best practices to follow.

# What is Microsoft Compliance Configuration Analyzer (MCCA)?

It is a PowerShell-based utility that will fetch your tenant’s current configurations & validate these configurations against Microsoft 365 recommended best practices. These best practices are based on a set of controls that include key regulations and standards for data protection and general data governance. MCCA then provides you with an actionable status report for improving your compliance posture.

# Why should I use it?

Often tenants face challenges in diagnosing their compliance posture & ensuring that they have the right configurations in place to protect their environment completely. These are largely manual processes which tend to be time consuming & allow for human error. Furthermore, with the evolving compliance landscape the risk of blind spots also increases.
MCCA is a diagnostic tool that will report the status of your current configurations. This allows you to focus efforts more on making the right configurations. 

# What is in scope?

This version will provide you recommendations for the M365 Compliance solutions listed below. We will keep adding more solutions & richer recommendations in future versions of this tool.
  
        1.	Microsoft Information Protection
            a. 	Data Loss Prevention

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Will this tool make any changes to my existing settings, policies, etc.?

MCCA is a diagnostic tool that is "read-only". It fetches information
about your current configurations to generate a report but will not
alter any of your existing configurations.

### What different sections do I see in my report?

The report provides you with:

*   Solutions summary: It provides a break-down of statuses at a
    solution level. Each solution has counters that tell you how many
    recommendations are informational, require improvement and are OK.

*   Solution drill-down: Following solutions summary, each solution has
    a separate section that provides detailed information about
    configurations & their status.

    *   Each solution may have 1 or more improvement actions which will
        further be broken down into finer configurations. MCCA will
        provide you a status both at an improvement action level & also
        for finer configurations.

### Can I generate report for specific sections within the report?

Yes, you can generate report for specific sections within the report.
You can use the solution input parameter `--solution <input solution
number>` to generate the report for a specific solution from the
following list:

|Input  |Solution |
|-------|-------------------------- |
|1      |Data Loss Prevention |
|2      |Information Protection |
|3      |Information Governance |
|4      |Records Management |
|5      |Communication Compliance |
|6      |Insider Risk Management |
|7      |Audit |
|8      |eDiscovery |

For e.g. If you wanted to create report for the DLP solution only then
you can run the following command:

```powershell
Get-MCCAReport --solution @(1)
```

You can learn more about this input parameter in the Input Parameters
section within the Install Guide above.

### What does Recommendation, Informational, Improvement & OK messages mean?

All recommendations provided by MCCA report are categorized in 3 types
of status:

*  Recommendations: These are best practices that your tenant
    should follow.\
    *Note: The support for these messages is limited in the current
    version so you may not see any recommendations in your report.*

*  Informational: These messages/statuses represent information
    in your current environment & are non-actionable in nature.

*  Improvement: These messages/statuses highlight areas that
    need your attention & are actionable. Sections which are marked as
    "Improvement" would generally have 1 or more configurations marked
    as "Improvement".

*  OK: These messages/statuses indicate that a given area is configured efficiently to meet data protection baselines.

### Why don't I see my tenant's name on the report?

Due to a technical error, the tool would not have been able to fetch
your tenant's name. In the event of such error, you may not see your
tenant name on the report. Please try running the tool again after some
time. If the issue persists, please reach out to us at
[MCCAhelp\@microsoft.com](mailto:mecahelp@microsoft.com) and/or contact
your Microsoft partner.

### Why do I see "No active policy defined" when I already have policies defined?

The policies created by you may be protecting a subset of information,
workloads, user groups and/or other criteria. "No active policy defined"
highlights the areas that are not protected by your current policies and
need an action on your part.

We provide "Remediation Scripts" which you can run from your PowerShell
console & the required policies will automatically be set up.

Please refer to "Remarks" section in your report to understand why you
are seeing "Improvement". If you still have concerns, please reach out
to us at [MCCAhelp\@microsoft.com](mailto:mecahelp@microsoft.com) or
contact your Microsoft partner.

### Why do I see "Policy defined but not protected on 1 or more workloads" when I already have policies defined?

Often there is a case where a given area (sensitive information,
workloads, user groups and/or other criteria) may be protected in 1 or
more policies in your environment but would not be protected across your
entire environment.

E.g. Your current policy configurations may U.S. / U.K. Passport Number
on SharePoint & Exchange but not on OneDrive & Teams. This puts you at
risk.

To avoid such cases, MCCA will highlight all the affected areas. You
will need to review these and either tweak your current policies and/or
create new ones to accommodate these areas.

### What are remediation scripts?

When MCCA identifies if your current policies have zero coverage for
certain sensitive information types, it provides you with "Remediation
Scripts" to help you avoid the hassle of manually setting up these
policies. These policies will be created in *Test* mode and you will
still have review & enable it manually.

You should review script parameters & then run these scripts from your *Windows PowerShell ISE* console.
You would need to connect to [Connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps) or [Connect to Exchange Online Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps) to execute these scripts. On successful execution of the scripts, the
required policies will automatically be set up.

Note: These scripts are pre-configured and may need tweaking to achieve
best results for your organization. We are working on improving these
scripts in future versions of this tool.

### Why is the report asking me to protect Sensitive Information Types which I do not have in my environment?

This version of the tool aims to protect all possible sensitive
information types across multiple geographies and/or industries.

Future versions of this tool will provide recommendations to you based
on the nature of information you have in your environment.

### Can I generate the report to get recommendations for Sensitive Information Types applicable to my tenant's geographic regions?

Yes, you can generate the report for specific geographic regions.

By default, the tool will generate a report based on the geolocation for
your tenant. If you wish to run the report for specific geos then while
running the `Get-MCCAReport` cmdlet, you can input an extra parameter by
`--Geo` followed by 1 or more region numbers supported by MCCA.

Please refer the *Install Guide* section above for more detailed steps.

### How can I add my organization's Logo in the report?

You can quickly add your organization's logo in the report by replacing the image file present in the Image folder with your logo's image with same name and file extension (i.e. logo.jpg). Please note that your logo image should be able to accurately fit within the width of 250px and height of 150px respectively.

### How do I save my report?

Please use the "Print" button provided on top right corner of the report
to export a PDF (subject to your browser and/or system support for
printing as a PDF) or print a physical copy of your report.
